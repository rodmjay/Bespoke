### Model Structure
The application uses TypeScript interfaces to define data models:

**Company Model**
```typescript
export interface CompanyDto {
  id: number;
  company: string;
  description: string;
  location: string;
  startDate: string;
  endDate?: string;
  positionCount: number;
}

export interface CompanyDetails extends CompanyDto {
  showTechnology: boolean;
  skills: CompanySkillDto[];
  positions: PositionDetails[];
}

export interface PositionDetails extends PositionDto {
  highlights: HighlightDto[];
}
```

**Person Model**
```typescript
export interface PersonDto {
  id: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  title: string;
}

export interface PersonDetails extends PersonDto {
  skills: Skill[];
  languages: Language[];
  education: Education[];
  resumes: Resume[];
}
```

### UI Framework
The application uses PrimeNG components for a consistent and professional UI:
- Tables with sorting and filtering
- Tabbed interfaces for organizing content
- Form controls with validation
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Toast notifications for user feedback

2. **Enhance Resume Management**
   - Complete resume creation and editing functionality
   - Implement template selection
   - Add preview and export capabilities

3. **Implement Education Management**
   - Create school and degree management components
   - Integrate with API services

   - Add skill categorization and rating
   - Integrate with API services

5. **Finalize Language Management**
   - Complete language selection with proficiency levels
   - Implement language proficiency visualization

## Testing Guidelines

When testing the application, focus on these key user flows:

1. **Person Management Flow**
   - Create a new person with all required fields
   - View person details
   - Edit person information
   - Add skills, education, and languages

2. **Company Management Flow**
   - Add a company to a person
   - View company details
   - Edit company information
   - Add positions and skills to a company

3. **Resume Management Flow**
   - Create a new resume
   - Select companies and skills to include
   - Configure resume settings
   - Preview and export the resume

## Known Issues

1. Some form components have placeholder implementations for add/edit/delete operations that will be fully implemented in the next phase.
2. The company form component needs additional validation for date fields.
3. Navigation between components needs to be enhanced for a smoother user experience.
4. Mock data is used in some components where API integration is not yet complete.

## Conclusion

The UI enhancements provide a solid foundation for the ResumePro application, with comprehensive person and company management functionality. The data seeding implementation ensures that integration tests have consistent test data across all tables. The next phase will focus on completing the remaining features and refining the user experience.
