1,1,1,1,"I had the opportunity to work with Rod as a fellow solutions architect at Kahoa. Rod was leading a team of developers to meet client software needs. During my time there, Rod was not only an outstanding project architect and team lead, but an outstanding individual contributor as well. He was still able to contribute just as much as the rest of his team did despite his additional leadership responsibilities.  Rod was also a central contributing figure to company architectural principles as a whole. He was was a senior member of Kahoa's architecture community, and helped guide discussions around software standards and best practices for the company as a whole. Rod is an excellent architect and software engineer. He has the ability to lead teams and projects, and has the grit to get them over the line when it's needed. I very highly recommend him to anyone seeking an outstanding software architect or team lead.","Joseph Cotton",NULL
