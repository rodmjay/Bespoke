# Bespoke Development Handoff Notes

## Current Status (March 20, 2025)

### ResumePro Cypress Testing Coverage

#### Current Test Coverage
The ResumePro Angular application currently has Cypress tests covering:
- Basic navigation (with some failing tests)
- Person creation functionality
- Person update functionality
- Resume creation functionality (with some failing tests)

#### Current Test Files
- `navigation.cy.js`: Tests basic navigation with some failing tests for person details and resume pages
- `person-creation.cy.js`: Tests the person creation form and validation
- `person-update.cy.js`: Tests the person update form and validation
- `resume-creation.cy.js`: Tests the resume creation form and validation

#### Issues Identified
1. Several navigation tests are failing, indicating incomplete implementation of navigation features
2. Resume creation tests are bypassing navigation due to failures in headless mode
3. No tests for resume viewing or updating
4. No tests for skills management
5. No tests for education history
6. No tests for work experience
7. No tests for resume generation/download

### Integration Tests Status
The integration tests are run as part of the `devin_test.sh` script, which:
1. Checks if the API is running, starts it if not
2. Checks if the Angular app is running, starts it if not
3. Runs integration tests with coverage
4. Runs Cypress tests

## Next Steps

### Cypress Testing Expansion
1. Fix failing navigation tests
2. Add tests for resume viewing
3. Add tests for resume updating
4. Add tests for skills management
5. Add tests for education history
6. Add tests for work experience
7. Add tests for resume generation/download
8. Improve error handling in existing tests

### Integration Tests
1. Ensure all integration tests are passing
2. Review coverage report to identify areas needing additional test coverage

## Implementation Plan
1. Run the test script to identify current failing tests
2. Fix failing navigation tests first
3. Implement missing test coverage in priority order
4. Ensure all tests pass in both headless and interactive modes
