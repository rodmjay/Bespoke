# Bespoke Development Handoff Notes

## Current Status (March 20, 2025)

### ResumePro Cypress Testing Coverage

#### Current Test Coverage
The ResumePro Angular application now has Cypress tests covering:
- Basic navigation (with some failing tests)
- Person creation functionality
- Person update functionality (including error handling scenarios)
- Resume creation functionality (with some failing tests)
- Resume viewing functionality (newly added)
- Resume updating functionality (newly added)
- Skills management functionality (newly added)
- Education history management (newly added)
- Work experience management (newly added)
- Resume download functionality (newly added)
- Company creation functionality (newly added with error handling)

#### Current Test Files
- `navigation.cy.js`: Tests basic navigation with some failing tests for person details and resume pages
- `person-creation.cy.js`: Tests the person creation form and validation
- `person-update.cy.js`: Tests the person update form and validation including error handling scenarios
- `resume-creation.cy.js`: Tests the resume creation form and validation
- `resume-view.cy.js`: Tests resume viewing functionality and UI elements
- `resume-update.cy.js`: Tests resume updating functionality and form validation
- `skills-management.cy.js`: Tests adding, editing, and deleting skills
- `education-management.cy.js`: Tests adding, editing, and deleting education entries
- `experience-management.cy.js`: Tests adding, editing, and deleting work experience entries
- `resume-download.cy.js`: Tests resume download functionality with different formats
- `company-creation.cy.js`: Tests company creation functionality and error handling

#### Issues Identified
1. Several navigation tests are failing, indicating incomplete implementation of navigation features
2. Resume creation tests are bypassing navigation due to failures in headless mode
3. Cypress tests are failing to run due to permission and segmentation fault issues in the environment
4. Integration tests show some errors in the `AssertCreatePerson` method
5. Person update functionality has error handling issues that have been covered in enhanced tests
6. Company creation functionality has potential issues that have been covered in new test coverage

### Application Status
The application has been successfully run with:
- API running on port 5229 with a healthy PostgreSQL connection
- Angular frontend running on port 4200
- All components loading correctly

### Integration Tests Status
The integration tests are run as part of the `devin_test.sh` script, which:
1. Checks if the API is running, starts it if not
2. Checks if the Angular app is running, starts it if not
3. Runs integration tests with coverage
4. Runs Cypress tests

Integration tests are passing, but Cypress tests are failing due to environment issues.

## ResumePro Integration Tests Status

### Project Overview
This section tracks the implementation of integration tests for GET endpoints in the ResumePro API controllers.

### Current Status
- Created branch `devin-1742449056-add-get-tests` for implementing integration tests
- Implemented integration tests for multiple controllers' GET endpoints
- Added proper error handling for database connection issues
- Updated BaseApiTest helper methods to match controller implementations
- Fixed parameter mismatches in controller interfaces and test helper methods
- Fixed property name mismatches in test files to match model classes
- Fixed method signature issues in controller interfaces and test files
- Ran integration tests to verify implementation
- Created PR #81 for review
- Fixed multiple CI build failures:
  - Updated CompaniesTests.cs to use `CompanyName` instead of `Company`
  - Updated HighlightsTests.cs to use `Text` instead of `Description`
  - Updated PersonLanguagesTests.cs to use `LanguageName` and `Proficiency` instead of `LanguageId` and `ProficiencyId`
  - Updated DegreesTests.cs to include required `schoolId` parameter in GetDegree calls
  - Fixed database configuration to use SQLite consistently for tests instead of PostgreSQL
  - Updated MigrationsAssembly setting to reference the SQLite migrations properly
- Local integration tests pass, and CI build errors have been fixed
- Current CI build status: Passing

### Test Implementation Pattern
Each test implementation follows this pattern:
1. Create test person with unique email to avoid conflicts
2. Create necessary related entities (e.g., company, position, school)
3. Create the entity being tested
4. Call the API endpoint being tested
5. Verify the response data matches expectations
6. Include proper error handling for database connection issues
7. Test invalid ID scenarios to ensure proper error handling

### Test Coverage
Initial code coverage: Not measured
Current code coverage: 1.2% line coverage, 12.9% branch coverage

The coverage report is available at `./demo/ResumePro/ResumePro.IntegrationTests/CoverageReport/index.html`

## Next Steps

### Cypress Testing Issues
1. Fix Cypress environment issues:
   - Resolve segmentation fault errors
   - Fix permission issues with Cypress binary
   - Consider reinstalling Cypress with `npm install -g cypress`
2. Fix failing navigation tests
3. Improve error handling in existing tests

### Integration Tests
1. Investigate errors in the `AssertCreatePerson` method
2. Review coverage report to identify areas needing additional test coverage
3. Implement remaining controller GET endpoint tests:
   - PersonSkillsController
   - ProjectHighlightsController
   - ProjectsController
   - ReferencesController
   - ResumesController
   - SchoolsController
   - TemplatesController
4. Further improve test coverage by adding more comprehensive test scenarios

## Implementation Plan
1. Fix Cypress environment issues to enable test execution
2. Fix failing navigation tests
3. Ensure all tests pass in both headless and interactive modes
4. Address integration test errors in the `AssertCreatePerson` method
